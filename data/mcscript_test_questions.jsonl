We purchased tickets to travel from Boston to New York City . As we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong . We walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there . Shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol . Anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway . The conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets . love scenery so I had the window seat watching everything along the way . First I saw large suburban areas but as we got into Connecticut many farms were being spotted . It was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere . Soon we approached NYC and the train came to slow stop , we had arrived at our destination . The ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long .", "question": "Where was the train at?"}

Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste, we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot. Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot, we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta. This tasted amazing and I felt that it was perfectly tasty and hot.", "question": "Did they use a fork or spoon to eat the pasta?"}

The first and largest thing to deal with was my apartment flat. I started by picking up any loose items that were not in their proper place. I put as many items into drawers and closets as possible to reduce clutter. I then moved all the furniture so I could clean the floors where the furniture is normally sitting. I vacuumed the exposed floor then moved the furniture back into place with a couple changes in the arrangement for fun. Then I swept the rest of the floor after dusting any surfaces that needed it. Afterwards, I cleaned all the windows, inside and out, and moved to the bathroom. After wiping down all the surfaces in the bathroom with a disinfecting cleaner, I took a look around my flat to assess my work. My apartment was now clean and it felt great!", "question": "When did they start?"}

She goes to the closet, picks out some nice clean sheets, with her favorite colors, and carries two sheets and two pillow cases to the bedroom.  She takes off the old sheets from her bed, and puts them in the hamper to be washed.  She then takes the fitted sheet with the rounded corners, and throws it onto the bed.  She pulls the corners down around the corners of the bed until it is tight. Then she puts the top sheet on her bed and tucks in the bottom part of her top sheet.  Then she takes the pillow cases and puts one on each pillow, to make a fresh clean bed.  She puts her cover on last, it is a blue one with little flowers.  She loves it, it came from her grandmother from Christmas. She fluffs the pillows and puts her favorite teddy bear to rest on the pillows as decoration.", "question": "Was it a grown up changing the bed sheets?"}

I work construction for my job so I need to have something that is able to tow and haul a lot of weight. One of the unfortunate side effects of owning such a large, mean truck, however, is the need to constantly put fuel in it! I usually go to the gas station twice a week to fill up my tank and empty my wallet. I pick a pump at my favorite gas station that is easy to drive into so I don't risk hitting other vehicles. I hop out and insert my credit card into the pump machine. After my card is read, I pull the gas nozzle off of the machine and insert it into my truck. I wait for what seems like forever as the pump fills my tank and the dollar amount endlessly increases.", "question": "How did they pay for the fuel?"}

All the left over plates, cups and utensils need to be cleared away to the kitchen to be washed.  The table top will also need to be wiped down of any food or spills, so it is fresh and clean for the next diners.   And if there are placemats they too will need replacing.  My favorite placemats are the ones you can color in, especially when they leave crayons on the table for you to use.  Once the new place mats are down, a whole new table setting can be done.  Often restaurants and cafes will have a special way they like their tables to be set up and its up to the wait staff to make sure that its done that way for every table.  It may involve fancy folded napkins, or how the glasses or utensils get lined up. Some times it involves a whole new setting of plates, utensils and glasses and other times the table is bare except for the salt and pepper shakers.  But regardless of what the restaurants table set up may look like, the table has to be ready so new customers can come in and enjoy their meal.", "question": "When was the last time they were cleaned?"}

We could have spent the whole day looking at all the paintings and talking about them. One painting had a lady in front of a house. It looked simple, but my friend Becky explained the painting to me. The painting had meanings or symbolism in it. She said it was like a story looking at the lady's facial expression and how her house looked. Next we went to look at the sculptures. There were very old ones and some modern ones as well. I think I liked the paintings better. I liked the colors of the painting.", "question": "Did they have dinosaurs at the museum ?"}

We went to a place that is pretty popular in town and has gotten really good reviews. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but soon enough we were seated. The restaurant had a warm and friendly feel, and our waiter appeared right after we were seated. She was warm and friendly too. She greeted us and asked for our drink orders. My husband just wanted water, but I got an unsweet tea with lemon. We chose not to order an appetizer, but the waitress brought our drinks and a basket of rolls for us to snack on. We ordered our entrees then, having had time to study the menu. My husband got a steak and baked potato with a side of steamed broccoli and I ordered the salmon and wild rice. Our waitress took the order, then promised to have our food out soon. We sampled the bread while she was gone. The rolls were delicious and the tea was refreshing. My husband and I began talking about how our days had been and discussing moving, which we are in the middle of currently. We talked for a few minutes until our food arrived, then settled down to eat. I had only taken a bite of my fish, however, when I realized that something was wrong. The smell was off and it had a bad taste. I thought it must be bad. I waited until our waitress was coming back by, then I asked her if she would take it back and bring me something different, because I felt like the salmon was going bad. She agreed and I ordered a steak like my husband got. He said his was delicious. The waitress took the fish and apologized profusely. She brought my steak out very shortly and it was fantastic. She kept checking on us throughout the meal, and the manager even came over to offer us a free dessert. He apologized for the salmon and said that the cook had made a mistake and pulled from the stock that was about to be thrown away. We accepted the free dessert, New York-style cheesecake. It was so creamy and sweet. We enjoyed our meal, overall. Our waitress brought us out ticket and even marked down our meal.

In order to calm him down, my dad went to the nearest hardware store to buy a brand new light bulb. He needed to make sure that the light bulb was the right size, so he took the old, burned out light bulb with him to compare. After finding the right size bulb, he paid for it and brought it back home. He then grabbed a nearby chair so that he could stand on to reach the empty socket where the bulb would go. He had me turn off the light switch, which would make sure that he would not get electrocuted while putting the bulb on or burned when it turns on. After less than 5 minutes, he is finished screwing in the bulb. We flip the switch to see if it works, and it does. My brother was now relieved.", "question": "Why didn't they wait to change the light bulb?"}
