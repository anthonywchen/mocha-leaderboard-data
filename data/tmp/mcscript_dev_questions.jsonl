I finished writing my letter and as I went to find a stamp and an envelope I needed to send it, I had found that I did not have any. I went to a store that sells cards and envelopes, and chose a box of pretty purple-colored envelopes to mail my letter in.  After that I went to the post office to purchase some stamps that are like small stickers, and chose a heart design that I liked. I only needed one to send the letter but I bought more so that I could send another letter soon if I wanted to. When I got home I filled out the envelope with Shelly’s name and address in the middle, and wrote my sister’s address in the top left corner of the envelope. I stuck the stamp with the heart design on it in the upper right corner. Now it was ready to be put in the mail and she will receive it in about one week. I drove to the post office and put my letter in the outgoing mail slot. Shelly will be so surprised!", "question": "Why did they write the letter?"}

Instead of being loud, like normal, it was fairly faint, and changing volume on it's own.  The light was also flickering a lot on the time readout.  I figured that the batteries were probably dying, so I decided to change them.  First, I looked in my cabinet to see if I had any spare batteries.  I didn't, so I drove to the grocery store to pick up some replacements.  I bought two AA batteries, and returned home with them.  I found my flat head  screwdriver in my tool box, and used it to pry open the battery compartment on the bottom of my alarm clock.  I then dislodged the old batteries with my fingers, and placed the new ones in the slots, with the positive and negative ends lining up appropriately.

But when I saw, it has one button missing. So I had to fix it. That button had 4 holes, so I wanted to fix in such a way that it looks good. So I had to choose exact matching color with my dress. The button was golden. I started to sew it on back side so , the knot will not show up. Then I poke my needle in one of the hole and stretched my thread all the way, then I inserted the needle in to the opposite side of hole. When it went down, I pulled it all the way, and then, got it out from the hole as which was empty so far, and then from above again I will repeat the same thing and insert the thread opposite to that hole. I will continue doing that till I feel like it is strong then I will make knot and fix it firmly with button. my job was done.", "question": "Were they experienced in sewing?"}
